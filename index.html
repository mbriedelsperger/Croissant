    <p class="m-4">A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, 
        but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiserie,
         are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, 
         then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
        
        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. 
        Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century.
         In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that can be freshly baked by unskilled labor. 
         The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 
         30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
        
        Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.</p>
